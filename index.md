### Greetings everyone! ✌️
I am a computer graphics and GPU programming enthusiast with a deep specialization in graphics API and low-level engine architecture. I thrive on the challenge of interacting directly with hardware, utilizing C/C++ to solve complex logical problems and optimize rendering algorithms for absolute peak performance.

My passion lies at the intersection of hardware and software, architecting robust, high-performance systems from the ground up that maximize modern GPU capabilities. I am driven by the pursuit of hardware-level perfection and a desire to push the boundaries of graphics tech.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with my custom rendering engines, software renderers and ray tracers. When I am not geeking out over the latest graphics APIs, I enjoy stepping away from the screen to play my guitar.

I am always open to collaborating on cutting-edge rendering projects or discussing low-level graphics optimizations. Please feel free to reach out if you share similar interests, let's connect and see what we can achieve together!
